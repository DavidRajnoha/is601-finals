## User Management System â€“ Final Project Reflection

### Project Overview

The **User Management System** is an open-source platform initiated by Professor Keith Williams at NJIT. It aims to enhance student engagement with the software industry through events such as company tours, guest lectures, and mock interviews. The system is designed to foster practical learning by connecting students with industry professionals and providing real-world project experience.

This document outlines the features implemented, bugs fixed, and tests added during the development process, along with reflections on my contributions and learning outcomes.

### Personal Reflection

_Working on this final project provided deep insight into team collaboration, GitHub-driven development workflows, and the importance of test coverage and CI/CD practices. I particularly enjoyed learning about Celery and RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing, and this experience significantly boosted my confidence in backend development and system architecture._
